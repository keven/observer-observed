# The Question Field

> "The observer is the observed" — J. Krishnamurti

An interactive art piece exploring the relationship between observation and creation.

## Concept

A blank page asks: "What do you see?"

As you type your answer, the page transforms into exactly that — describe "darkness" and it darkens; type "fractals" and fractals emerge; say "stars" and stars appear.

The revelation: you were never observing the page. You were constructing it. The observation *was* the creation.

## How It Works

Type words and watch the visual field respond:

### Colors
`red`, `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `gold`, `white`, `black`, `cyan`, `pink`

### Light & Dark
`dark`, `darkness`, `light`, `bright`, `glow`, `shadow`

### Fractals
`fractal`, `tree`, `branches`, `spiral`, `mandala`, `flower`, `sierpinski`, `triangle`

### Nature
`stars`, `cosmos`, `galaxy`, `universe`, `water`, `ocean`, `waves`, `fire`, `flames`

### Abstract
`nothing`, `void`, `empty`, `everything`, `infinite`, `chaos`, `order`, `pattern`, `geometry`

### Movement
`still`, `stillness`, `calm`, `peace`, `flow`, `movement`, `spin`, `dance`, `breathe`, `pulse`

### Concepts
`love`, `fear`, `joy`, `thought`, `mind`, `consciousness`, `awareness`, `silence`, `dream`, `eternity`, `life`, `death`, `soul`, `truth`, `beauty`, `observer`, `observed`, `unity`, `wholeness`

## The Reveal

After you've typed enough words and pause, the truth emerges:

> You believed you were describing what you saw.
> But there was nothing here until you named it.
> Your words didn't reflect reality — they created it.
> The one who looks and what is seen are not two things.

## Technical

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No dependencies. Features:
- Canvas-based generative visuals
- Recursive fractal algorithms (tree, spiral, mandala, Sierpinski)
- Particle systems
- Real-time keyword parsing
- Smooth state transitions

## Philosophy

This piece is inspired by the dialogues between Jiddu Krishnamurti and physicist David Bohm, particularly their exploration of how thought constructs the reality it claims to observe.
